        <p>Your branding and website should reflect the caliber of your work. Branding and design can feel mysterious, but since you’re still reading, it means that you at lease <em>suspect</em> how important branding is to the success and long-term viability of a business.</p>
        <p>Your brand identity is not just your logo and the colors you use, it’s a holistic, strategic effort to communicate your company's identity to your potential customers &mdash; An effort to turn them from prospects into buyers.</p>
        <p>Companies that invest in their brands consistently outperform their competitors. You need a brand and website that works hard like you do. And I can make it for you.</p>

      <p>As a designer and web developer with more than a decade of experience in the design and digital landscape, I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. I'm here to level-up your online presence and modernize your style while staying true to your company's core personality.</p>
      <p>If you work with me you'll have:</p>
      <ul class="success-list">
        <li>Branding materials that represent the vision of your business</li>
        <li>Content hierarchy for what your users are seeking</li>
        <li>Modern aesthetic showing you care about your online reputation</li>
        <li>A responsive website so your business meets users where they are – on their phones</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>When you work with me, you should expect questions like “What are your key differentiators?” and “What are the primary goals of your target audience?” not “What colors do want your buttons to be?”</p>
      <p>I’m not a good fit for you if:</p>
      <ul class="failure-list">
          <li>You are looking for someone to just “make it pretty.”</li>
          <li>You don’t like someone asking questions and you want them the to blindly follow instructions.</li>
          <li>You aren’t open to someone pushing back on ideas in order to advocate for your end users and customers.</li>
          <li>You're attached to your old ways of doing things because "This is the way we've always done it," a.k.a.- its easy and comfortable.</li>
