<p class="section-heading">Let's take your business's brand to the next level</p>
<p>I am a web design and development manager of an enterprise-wide university website with 200+ CMS editors. I have over nine years of experience in various areas of design including web, digital, and print design, and have eight years of service in the higher education landscape. I currently oversee the style, structure, functionality, and technical advancement of the university's web spaces, and design and build new pages and sites for high-level initiatives. I enjoy the complex artistry of web design and the structure and exactness of front-end code. I crave organization and I'm motivated by helping others achieve their goals.</p>

<p>I like good paper, home DIY projects, and strawberry cheesecake.
(And I don't think that fruit should be on pizza.)</p>
