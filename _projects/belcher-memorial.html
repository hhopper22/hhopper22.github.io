            <p>This print catalog showcases products crafted by individuals in Haiti. <a href="https://www.haitimade.com/" target="_blank">Haiti Made</a> fights the cycle of poverty in Haiti through job creation and increased economic sustainability. This Haitian-operated company empowers individuals to provide for families and create careers while producing quality handmade goods.</p>
            <p>In 2014, I had the opportunity to visit their studio and learn about their processes and operations firsthand. I was proud to work with the company to design a new catalog of their 2015 product offerings.</p>
