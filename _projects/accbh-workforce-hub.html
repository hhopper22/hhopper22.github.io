            <p>I worked with the Appalachian Children Coalition (ACC) to create a brand identity for their new initiative - a behavioral health workforce hub. I created a logo for the hub and designed and developed their new website. It was important for the new identity to feel heavily tied to the existing ACC brand since it lives under the umbrella of this organization.  I carefully considered the client's brand voice and the design themes in the ACC logo while developing the Hub's mark. We utilized their established font palette for the hub and built from their exisiting ACC color palette.</p>

            <p>The shaking hands in the logo represent collaboration and commitment while also implying someone reaching down to pull another up, much like the rising movement of climbing stairs in the ACC logo. I love the way the hands integrate with the shape of the state. This mark is strong enough to stand on its own while still mirroring the ACC logo. The approachable link of the hands lands right over the center of the Appalachian Ohio region, representing an impactful connection.</p>
