            <p>In the summer and early autumn of 2019, I redesigned and developed the Western Carolina University (WCU) homepage. WCU is a a mid-sized, regional university located in western North Carolina. I worked on user experience, designed the new homepage from scratch, and completed prototyping and development for this homepage overhaul. Below I walk through the process of this project.

                <h2 class="one-half-rem">Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>As part of an update to the WCU website, WCU needed to change the content on their homepage, using this as an opportunity to improve a noticeably repetitious experience and refresh the design.</p>

            <p>Prior to beginning the design process we conducted user testing with individuals in external prospective student and prospective parent demographics. We also received feedback from within the department and institution.</p>    
            <p class="mb-0">Some examples of feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Story content was hidden in a carousel</li>
                <li>Links to important content were getting missed</li>
                <li>Redundant or repeated text and image content</li>
                <li>The social media feed sometimes looked broken</li>
                <li>People were seeking Youtube and Twitter posts in the social media feed</li>
                <li>Events were repeated multiple times and web editors were unable to curate the events feed</li>

            <h3>Early Design</h3>
            <p>After gathering all of the data and feedback I began designing, starting with hand drawn sketches to quickly iterate through ideas.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5 order-md-7">
            <p>I then developed a handful of different design versions using Adobe XD and sought feedback from collegues in my department. We selected one design with which to move forward.</p>

        <div class="col-md-3 order-md-11">
            <p>I took the selected design and worked out all of the details, determined how the layout would respond, and added some prototyping interactivity to show how the page would function.</p>

            <h3>Development and Launch</h3>
            <p>In this project I managed and participated in the entire development process. I first developed the page layout locally. I then collaborated via git with another front-end developer to integrate the code into the CMS in a test environment, which included building new elements into the siteâ€™s XSL. After repeated testing and working out the bugs, we replaced the homepage with the new code. Finally, we published the new page!</p>
