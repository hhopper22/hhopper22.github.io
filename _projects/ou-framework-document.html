            <p>This printed booklet provides an in-depth breakdown of Ohio University's strategic plan. It contains four strategic themes and defines eleven major initiatives that support the reshaping of Ohio University to best position it for the future.</p>
            <p>I was provided with a variety of stunning images for use in this publication that inspired me to use photography as a playful focal point of the design. I enjoyed creating a balance between the longform copy, bulleted text, and colorful visuals showcasing university activities. Throughout the 30-page booklet I employed a flexible grid that allowed the text and photography to push and pull across the pages.</p>
