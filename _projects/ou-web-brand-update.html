    <p>Goal 4 – Begin implementation of new branding elements on the ohio.edu website to modernize the site, cement the Forever OHIO identity, and create visual cohesion between the website and print, digital advertising, video, social media channels. Include a systematic update of the on-page typefaces to the new brand typefaces globally on ohio.edu webpages.
    </p>
    <p>  Self-Assessment  – This is a multifacted project with many pieces that are successfully completed. In collaboration with collegues, I have updated the universal OHIO footer, the ohio.edu homepage, a primary Forever marketing campaign landing page, and the new Give website homepage. In addition to these larger projects, branding elements (such as badge illustrations) and the new typefaces have been implemented on various individual pages, such as the new Marching 110 homepage. Other projects are already in progress that include implementation of the new branding elements. These include the new Athens building directory, an updated Ohio Facts page, and a new design for the RHE Slate account. The systematic assessment of typefaces throughout the site is underway and on-track for a rollout of the new fonts universally on the site before the end of the fiscal year. While many parts of this project are yet to come, the intial roll-out has been a success.

    <p>  Supervisor Comments – Haley has effectively integrated the new branding elements into the Ohio University website through a combination of page-level updates and global component updates. She is leading the rollout of the new fonts universally and is on track to complete this by July 1. She is also the design and development lead on a cross-collaborative project with the print design team to develop a new in-brand design system for the Drupal CMS website components.
        </p>

       <p>   Goal 2 – In order to focus on an internally-initiated, strategic long-term project to improve the O.U. website, I will lead a project to audit, rebrand and improve web elements in the Drupal C.M.S. I will work with the Web Developer/Designer and Front-end Developer to continue the updates to the overall branding on the university website by redesigning 10 existing web elements and implementating three new branded elements on the website. This will modernize the site, cement the Forever OHIO identity, and create visual cohesion between the website and print, digital advertising, video, social media channels. We will also refactor the code of many of our web elements to improve performance, function, usability, and editability. We will complete these updates by December 15, 2021.</p>

 <p> Self-Assessment  – This UCM initiated project ran into several hurdles that affected bandwidth and timeline, including the departure of the Front-end Developer from the team. I am proud that by the December 15 deadline we were able to update 9 existing components for brand alignment, usability, or performance, but unfortunately this project was put on hold. Despite many roadblocks, I continued to push this project forward amidst more urgent priorities. Prior to May 15th, 2022, in total, we updated 14 existing elements and implement one new element, which I wholly designed and built. We have received positive feedback from web editors regarding the expanded options provided by the updates. These updates also allowed our Web Team collegues to move forward with page templates for editors.</p>

 <p> Supervisor Comments – Haley has done an outstanding job leading the Drupal Component Audit & Rebrand project, which was a major undertaking. This effort uplifts the OHIO brand by ensuring consistency; and Haley’s design skills speak for themselves in the success of this project carefully considering the branding elements and the visual appeal of the elements collectively. Not only did this improve the visual branding, which was the initial goal. But Haley and team also utilized this project as an opportunity to refactor the elements to make improvements in web accessibility, performance, and editor experience. By capitilizing on this opportunity to evaluate the accessibility and performance implications of each element, this positively contributed to increased website performance scores and increased WCAG accessibility scores. Also, when refactoring each of the elements, our editor experience was top of mind and the fields/options/etc. were strategically rethought and implemented. </p>
