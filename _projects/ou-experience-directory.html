        <h3 class="section-heading">Process</h3>
        <p>A digital tool for filtering and finding experiences did not exist at the university, so we had freedom to decide the functionality, look, and content of the site. </p>
        <p>Our team leader gathered content specifications from multiple departments and organizations across the university. We determined that a new content type was needed in Drupal to organize and display the information for each experience, and a filterable landing page was needed so students could quickly find experiences that are relevant to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-xl-6 offset-xl-3">
        <h4>Research and Prototyping</h4>
        <p>Filtering the experiences is one of the most important aspects of this project. We needed a way for someone to filter our experiences on multiple criteria, and be capable of selecting multiple options for each criteria. <i>(Since I enjoy DIY home improvement projects, the first thing that came to mind is trying to find a light fixture on a home improvement website.)</i> I researched existing user interface patterns for applied filters from a category, dropdowns, checklists, and more. I also looked to our own existing checklist and filter styles.</p>
        <p>I then prototyped a new filter user interface for our page, seeking feedback from my teammates. My co-developer and I talked through the proposed behavior and functionality in the UI, ensuring we covered all the use cases.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-xl-6 offset-xl-3">
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>In Adobe XD I designed the styling, layout and functionality for two new web page layouts - one interior page that displays information for each individual experience and one landing page with search and filtering capabilities.</p>
        <p>I also designed the new featured experience section of the ohio.edu homepage in Adobe XD and shared it with leadership for feedback.</p>

        <h5>Adaptable Details</h5>
        <p>The icons and colors in this "Details" section of an individual Experience page change depending on the information input into Drupal for the specific experience. These features give site users quick details through visual cues.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-xl-6 offset-xl-3">
        <h4>Development</h4>   
        <p>I collaborated with my partner web developer to create the new and unique features and filtering functionality for the landing page. They developed the interface based on my specifications, XD design files, and feedback.</p>
        <p>For the experience pages I created a new Drupal content type with 17 fields, four new taxonomies with 52 associated terms, and three new view blocks. I then developed the individual experience page template and functionality, as well as the featured experience section of the ohio.edu homepage.</p>
