        <p>This website project aims to showcase unique learning opportunities available to Ohio University students. I worked to design and develop two new web page layouts - one interior page that displays data for each individual experience and one landing page with search and filtering capabilities - and a 'featured experience' layout to display on the university website homepage.</p>

        <p>The icons and colors in this "Details" section of an individual Experience page change depending on the information input into Drupal for the specific experience. These features give site users quick details through visual cues.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Project Background</h2>
        <p>In early 2022 the university president announced his No. 1 Priority: Continued improvement of student experience and success.</p>
        <blockquote>"President Sherman is committed to expanding opportunities for every student to build a portfolio of experiences during their time at OHIO, closing equity gaps in student success, and ensuring students graduate on time and ready to move into graduate studies or their career of choice."</blockquote>
        <p>In order to deliver on <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/news/2021/03/ohio-delivers-unified-brand-promise" target="_blank">our brand promise</a> and support President Shermanâ€™s No. 1 priority, we leveraged the university website to showcase the myriad of unique learning opportunities available to Ohio University students.</p>
