    <p>The chosen color palette for the wedding was plum and greenery. The couple included the reading of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A25-34&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 6:25-34</a> in the ceremony and wanted feathers featured in the invitation to align with this theme.</p>
