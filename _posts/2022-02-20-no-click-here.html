<p>Your links should always contain descriptive text that lets the user know what information they will find after clicking the link.</p>
<p>Not everyone is clicking</p>
<p>Links are styled differently so they stand out. People scan the page, but scanning 7 “click here”s doesn’t help them know what your content is.</p>
<p>When you tab through a page, it skips from link to link and reads the link text to users. This is useless if the link text isn’t descriptive.</p>
