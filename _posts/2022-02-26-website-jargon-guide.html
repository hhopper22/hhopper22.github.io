<p>What the heck do all of those words mean that your web designer keeps saying?!</p>

<h2>Terms and Explanations</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Breakpoint</dt>
        <dd>A breakpoint is a specific measurement (typically width) of your users screen at which the layout will change or shift. Breakpoints are used in code to tell the web browser which layouts and sizes to apply from the code in order to properly size your content for a user's current window or device width.</dd>
    <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>"CSS" stands for 'cascading style sheets.' (You do not need to remember this.) CSS is the code in a website that dictates how various web elements appear on the screen. It includes rules for font sizes, colors, layout, image sizing, and much more.</dd>
    <dt>CTA</dt>
        <dd>This acronym means "call to action." In your website it is important to provide simple and clear indications to your users for the actions you want them to take next, a 'call to action.' CTAs are often used as buttons or elements with visual importance and represent a next step for your users, such as "Add to Cart" or "Apply Now."</dd>

        <dd>"UX" stands for 'user experience.' The user's experience of a website encompasses their entire interaction with your digital product.

When we focus on the user's experience we aim to remove friction and make the interaction process simple and smooth.</dd>
    <dt>Viewport</dt>
        <dd>The viewport refers to the contraint of a users viewing area for your website. This could be their cellphone or tablet screen, or their web browser window.

A user can change their viewport by resizing their browser window, or rotating their handheld device into a different orientation.</dd>
