  <li>Provide a designer with context for your projects. The more informaiton about your business, goals, audience, and strengths you can provide, the better a designer can tailor their work to your needs.</li>
  <li>Provide examples of what you like</li>
  <li>You aren't the only client. Designers have other work for other people who need it done, just like you. They cannot often drop what they are doing to help you with your crisis.</li>
  <li>Respect their expertise. A designer is not your puppet.</li>
