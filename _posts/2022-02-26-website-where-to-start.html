<p>So you've decided you want (or need) a website. You're planning to reach out to a web designer/agency/marketing department, and you're nervous about their expectations. Here's a list of things you can bring with you 'to the table'</p>
<ul>
    <li>How should you get started?</li>
    <li>When you mean with.. someone, what questions should you be prepared to answer?</li>
    <li>Who should you reach out to, anyway?</li>
</ul> </p>

The pro you are talk to will likely NOT expect you to know:
<ul>
    <li>The jargon of websites: If you know what a 'breakpoint' is or what "SEO" stands for, great. But if not, its no big deal. You aren't expected to know all about this- that's why you're working with someone who does this full-time.</li>
    <li>Exactly how you want your website content set up or visual layout to look: It is a normal part of the process for the professionals to determine these foundations for your website.</li>
</ul>
