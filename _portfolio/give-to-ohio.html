<p>This new website showcases the stories of the WCU community. The site provides a digital space for content marketing articles, news, and announcements to live together- a space previously unpossessed by the university. I designed an entirely new navigation experience and page layout for this site, creating a landing page which displays a diverse set of static and feed-based content.</p>
