            <p>Project showing you today is the redesign of the western carolina university homepage that launched last fall

                I worked on user experience, did both design and development on this project, and designed the new homepage from scratch
                
                I’m going to talk through the process of this project, and some of the tools used in the process

            <h3>User Experience Research</h3>
            <p>UX Input:
                External User Testing
                Internal Feedback
                Technical Issues
                </p>
            <p>Prior to beginning the design process

                We conducted user testing with individuals in external prospective student and prospective parent demographics
                
                We also received feedback from within the department and institution,
                
                and we had some goals of our own.
                
                Some examples of feedback were….
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hidden story content</li>
                    <li>Unneeded descriptions</li>
                    <li>Repeated images</li>
                    <li>Broken if video or not square</li>
                    <li>Repeated events</li>
                    <li>Getting missed</li>
                    <li>Redundant content</li>
                    <li>Add Youtube and Twitter</li>
                    <li>Not able to curate</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Early design</p>
            <p>After gathering all of the data and feedback I began designing, 
                starting with hand drawn sketches to quickly iterate through ideas
                </p>
            <p>prototyping</p>
            <p>Then I went into Adobe XD and Developed a handful of different versions

                showed them to a team of people in my department for feedback
                
                We selected one
                </p>
            <p>refinement</p>
            <p>I took the design we selected and worked out all of the details

                determined how the layout would respond,
                
                and added some prototyping interactivity to show how the page would function
                </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Responsive Layouts</h3>
            <p>development and launch</p>
            <p>For this project I managed and participated in the entire development process

                Developed the layout locally-- I use Brackets (which is Adobe’s source code editor)
                
                Part of the way through development another front-end developer joined the project and we collaborated on the code using Git
                
                then we integrated into the CMS in a test environment, which included building new elements into the site’s XSL
                
                After we worked out the bugs,
                
                we replaced the homepage with the new code,
                
                And launched the new page
                </p>
