            <li>You're out-of-touch with today's customers</li>

        <p>I don't just care about good design. I care about your business success.</p>
        <p>High-caliber branding tells your customers you care about reputation and quality. I'm here to help you level-up your brand so you can focus on the reasons you started your small business in the first place: to improve people's lives through superior experiences, products, and services.</p>

        <p>When you work with me, you should expect questions like “What are your key differentiators?” and “What are the primary goals of your target audience?” not “What colors do want your buttons to be?”</p>
        <p>I’m not a good fit for you if:</p>
        <ul class="failure-list">
            <li>You are looking for someone to just “make it pretty.”</li>
            <li>You don’t like someone asking questions and you want them the to blindly follow instructions.</li>
            <li>You aren’t open to someone pushing back on ideas in order to advocate for your end users and customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do we sound like a match? Tell me about your project.</p>
